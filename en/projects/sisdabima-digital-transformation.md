## üéØ Project Overview

**Duration:** September 2021 - November 2021  
**Role:** Freelance Software Engineer (Architect, Backend Developer & Technical Lead)  
**Client:** DSDABMBK (Water Resources, Roads & Construction Office) - Bekasi Regency

**SISDABIMA (Water Resources and Road Management Service System)** is a web-based application I developed to revolutionize service systems at the **Water Resources, Roads & Construction Office (DSDABMBK) Bekasi Regency**.

This project transformed services that were previously **100% manual** into an integrated digital system, resulting in **70% reduction in service processing time** and enabling real-time application status tracking for citizens.

## üöÄ The Challenge

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual Service System Problems</strong></summary>

Before SISDABIMA, DSDABMBK faced major challenges:

- **Manual Processes:** All application workflows were face-to-face and paper-based
- **Long Service Times:** Average processing took **7-14 working days**
- **Lack of Transparency:** Applicants couldn't track their application status
- **Limited Digital Legitimacy:** No legal framework for electronic services

This created **high administrative burdens**, service delays, and reduced citizen satisfaction.

```

As a solution, I developed an **integrated digital platform** with end-to-end digitalized service workflows.

### üîß Core Features & Capabilities

#### **Integrated Online Services**
- Citizens can submit service applications from anywhere, 24/7
- Complete digital workflow from submission ‚Üí verification ‚Üí scheduling ‚Üí document issuance

#### **Process Transparency**
- Real-time status tracking for applicants
- Automated notification system for status updates

#### **Strong Legal Foundation**
- System operations supported by **Bekasi Regent Regulation No. 64 of 2021**
- Fully compliant with local government digital service requirements

#### **Priority Services**
- Initial phase focused on **flood management** and **concrete material testing**
- Two most critical field requirements identified

## üõ†Ô∏è My Technical Contributions

### Architect, Backend Developer & Technical Lead

I handled the complete technical development cycle, from architecture design to production deployment.

#### 1. **Architecture Design & Technology Selection**
- Designed **REST API-based architecture** despite using CodeIgniter 3, to separate backend & frontend and enable future integrations
- Selected **Redis** not only for *caching*, but also as **queue system** to keep application responsive under high load

#### 2. **Backend Development & Integration**
- Built all **REST API endpoints**: authentication, master data management, to business logic services
- Integrated APIs with Bootstrap-based frontend for smooth data flow according to UX design
- Ensured end-to-end testing met department & regulatory requirements

#### 3. **Deployment & Infrastructure**
- Designed and managed infrastructure on **local private cloud**
- My tasks included:
  - Zero-to-production server setup on **Ubuntu Linux**
  - **Apache Web Server** + **PHP 7.3** installation & optimization
  - **MySQL** + **Redis** management
  - Server security hardening & performance monitoring
- Direct coordination with department officials & frontend team for field-ready system
