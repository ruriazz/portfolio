## 🎯 Project Overview

**Duration:** July 2021 - September 2021  
**Role:** Backend & Real-Time Communication Engineer  
**Company:** PT TOGU Inovasi Teknologi

**Wello** is a social media application developed by **PT TOGU Inovasi Teknologi** as part of the ambitious *"Hundred Apps Project"* initiative. The application was designed to deliver modern communication experiences comparable to popular platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, and LINE.

Wello integrates various real-time communication features, from **private chat**, **group chat**, **voice calls**, **video calls**, to the unique **push-to-talk (walkie-talkie)** feature. This project became one of the early milestones in my career journey, where I played a role in building the backend foundation and real-time communication integration.

## 🚀 The Challenge

<details>
<summary><strong>Real-Time Communication Technical Challenges</strong></summary>

In designing a real-time communication application, the team faced several complex technical challenges:

- **Real-Time Communication:** Required reliable protocols to support *low latency* needs for chat, voice calls, and video calls
- **Different Technology Integration:** Needed to combine **WebRTC**-based services for voice and video calls with **XMPP** for chat to function seamlessly
- **Initial Scalability:** System had to handle hundreds to thousands of simultaneous users, even in early development stages
- **Time Constraints:** This project ran parallel with other applications under the *Hundred Apps* initiative, requiring efficient development

## 🛠️ My Technical Contributions

### Backend & Real-Time Communication Engineer

In the Wello project, I held primary responsibility on the backend side, from research and design to technical implementation:

#### 1. **Research & System Design**
- Conducted technology research for real-time communication: **XMPP**, **WebRTC**, and **WebSocket**
- Designed database and system architecture to accommodate chat, call, and group features

#### 2. **Backend Implementation & Integration**
- Built **REST API** for authentication, user management, and basic communication workflows
- Integrated **XMPP** for chat and group chat features
- Provided **WebSocket signaling server** to support **WebRTC** (voice & video calls)
- Developed special workflow for **push-to-talk** feature

#### 3. **Deployment & Maintenance**
- Handled initial deployment on company internal servers
- Performed monitoring and bug fixes during internal development phase

    September 2021 : Testing & Integration
                   : Internal Demo Preparation
```

Although this project did not reach **production release** stage because I decided to continue my career at another company, my contributions laid important foundations for Wello:

| Aspect | Before Wello | After Wello Implementation |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| **Communication** | Only manual via other chat apps | **Internal platform available with chat, group, voice & video calls** |
| **Real-Time Technology** | None available | **WebRTC & XMPP successfully integrated** |
| **Unique Features** | None | **Push-to-Talk (Walkie-Talkie) available** |
