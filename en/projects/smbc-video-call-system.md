## 🎯 **The Business Challenge**

<div align="center">

**SMBC Indonesia needed to modernize their video call assignment system to serve customers more efficiently across multiple banking channels, including their premium Sinaya Prioritas service.**

</div>

### 📉 **Problems with Legacy System**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**🔄 Inefficient Polling Model**
- Agents repeatedly polled APIs to check for incoming calls
- High server load from constant HTTP requests
- Unnecessary latency in call assignments
- Resource waste and poor scalability

**⚖️ First-Come-First-Serve Limitations**
- No priority-based assignment logic
- Customer importance not considered
- Agent specialization ignored
- Poor load distribution

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**📊 Business Impact**
- Suboptimal customer service experience
- Agent frustration with slow systems
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Limited scalability for growth

**🚫 Technical Debt**
- Legacy architecture constraints
- No real-time capabilities
- Difficult to maintain and extend
- Performance bottlenecks

### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Strategy**

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Phase 1: Redis Stream + WebSocket**
- ✅ Incoming calls pushed to **Redis Stream**
- ✅ Agents receive automatic **WebSocket notifications**
- ✅ Eliminated API polling completely
- ✅ Immediate performance improvement

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Phase 2: Advanced Priority System**
- ✅ Migrated to **Redis Sorted Set + Hash**
- ✅ Score-based priority assignments
- ✅ **Redis Pub/Sub** for event distribution
- ✅ Business rule integration
